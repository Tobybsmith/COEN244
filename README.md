# BongoDB
This is my database for my COEN244 project. It is supposed to be a graph database using nodes and edges.
//TODO
- Files dont get created by constructor.
- Be able to load a database from it's .bongobd file
- Be able to load key-val pairs from node's .bongo file
- Be able to use links to access content from other linked .bongo files
- Make the UX not garbage
- Make it not crash and warn user instead when bad things happen
- Revamp commands and functionality
- Find a way to create directories and use them to store databases in their own directories
- More features like copying nodes, deleting nodes maybe, and showing links between nodes
