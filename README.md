# BongoDB
This is my database for my COEN244 project. It is supposed to be a graph database using nodes and edges.
//TODO
- ~~Files dont get created by constructor.~~
- ~~Be able to load a database from it's .bongobd file~~
- Be able to write key-val pairs to a node's file
- Be able to load key-val pairs from node's .bongo file
- - Need to write change to file before a &
- - Need to create temp copy and rename after
- - Way to copy nodes with or without copying links
- Be able to use links to access content from other linked .bongo files
- Make the UX not garbage
- Make it not crash and warn user instead when bad things happen
- Revamp commands and functionality
- Find a way to create directories and use them to store databases in their own directories
# Long Term Goals
//TODO
- More features like copying nodes, deleting nodes maybe, and showing links between nodes
- Types need to work, but why
- Database needs to be better and have some way to access it via code
